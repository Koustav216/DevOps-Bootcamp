## Introduction

- Devops is a culture that imporoves organisation's ability to deliver software. E.g. Suppose ABC Organisation takes 10 days only to deliver (excluding coding etc.) a software update. But using DevOps we can significantly reduce the time taken to deliver the update.

- Devops also deals with
  - Automation
  - Quality
  - Monitoring i.e. Continuous checks for assuring quality and finding errors
  - Testing

- DevOps is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring proper automation, quality maintenance, continuous monitoring, continuous tesing.

### Why DevOps?
Before Devops, to take an application from the developer's PC to the production server, we had to go through several manual processes:

- The System admin would create a server for testing.
- The server admin would create an app server in server itself.
- Build and Release Enginner would install the app in the app server 
- Now tester would test the app.
- After testing, the Build and Release Engineer would push it to the pre-production or production environment.

Such manual procedures made the entire system inefficient, hence we moved to DevOps.

As a DevOps Engineer we should have the mindset to adopt to changes in our workprocess with the aim of increasing the efficieny of the organisation.
