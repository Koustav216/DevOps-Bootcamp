## Introduction

- Devops is a culture that imporoves organisation's ability to deliver software. E.g. Suppose ABC Organisation takes 10 days only to deliver (excluding coding etc.) a software update. But using DevOps we can significantly reduce the time taken to deliver the update.

- Devops also deals with
  - Automation
  - Quality
  - Monitoring i.e. Continuous checks for assuring quality and finding errors
  - Testing

- DevOps is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring proper automation, quality maintenance, continuous monitoring, continuous tesing.

- DevOps is the bridge between development and operations"

  DevOps is more than just a methodology-it's a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with greater efficiency. By integrating automation, monitoring, and continuous feedback loops, DevOps enables organizations to adapt to the rapidly changing tech landscape.

In simple terms, DevOps bridges the gap between developers (who write code) and operations teams (who deploy and manage systems), ensuring a smooth pipeline from idea to production.

### Why DevOps?
Before Devops, to take an application from the developer's PC to the production server, we had to go through several manual processes:

- The System admin would create a server for testing.
- The server admin would create an app server in server itself.
- Build and Release Enginner would install the app in the app server 
- Now tester would test the app.
- After testing, the Build and Release Engineer would push it to the pre-production or production environment.

Such manual procedures made the entire system inefficient, hence we moved to DevOps.

As a DevOps Engineer we should have the mindset to adopt to changes in our workprocess with the aim of increasing the efficieny of the organisation.

### How to Introduce?

While introducing ourselves as a DevOps Engineer, we must mention

- No of years as a DevOps Engineer.
- Previous experience (as a programmer / system admin) before joining DevOps role.
- Explain roles and activities performed as a DevOps Enginner.
- Mention about different tools
