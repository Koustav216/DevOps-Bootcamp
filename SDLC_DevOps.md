- As a DevOps Enginner our focus should be mainly in Coding, Testing and Delivery/Deployment phase.

- Coding: The app is coded as per design specifications.
- Testing: Application stored in VCS (say Git) is deployed in a server. It is tested by Quality Assurance Engineers.
- Deployment: The App is pushed to the production environment.

Using DevOps, our aim is to make the above three processes quicker using Automation.
