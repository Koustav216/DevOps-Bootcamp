### Reverse Proxy
A forward proxy acts on behalf of clients (or requesting hosts). Forward proxies can hide the identities of clients whereas reverse proxies can hide the identities of servers. Reverse proxies have several use cases, a few are:

- Load balancing: distribute the load to several web servers,
- Cache static content: offload the web servers by caching static content like pictures,
- Compression: compress and optimize content to speed up load time.
